  h1 API Basejump: Timestamp microservice
  p 1) I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)
  p 2) If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
  p 3) If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.

  h3 Example usage:
  code https://timestampkevinfcc.herokuapp.com/December%2015,%202015
  br
  code https://timestampkevinfcc.herokuapp.com/1450137600

  h3 Example output:
  code { "unix": 1450137600, "natural": "December 15, 2015" }
